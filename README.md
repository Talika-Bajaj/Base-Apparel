# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page

![Design preview for the Base Apparel coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 18th Frontend Mentor coding challenge.

In this challenge, I've designed a sleek landing page with HTML/CSS, featuring a user-friendly form. Utilizing regular expressions, I've implemented email validation, ensuring entered email IDs match the required pattern. If an incorrect format is detected, a prompt notifies users, enhancing the page's usability and interaction.


**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
